# Testing

- Check important retained and changed behavior at a stable boundary, including failure paths and interactions with a concrete regression risk.
- Assertions should distinguish correct behavior from the reported defect and survive implementation changes. Tests for retired mechanisms may also retire.
- Prefer existing deterministic test facilities. Do not demand a separate test for every error message, comparison, or internal helper. External service checks require appropriate authorization.
