# Ox Skills

## Skills

Each artifact directory may contain a `_template.md`; if it does, the skill uses it, otherwise the skill falls back to its built-in default template.

### `/ox-init`

Creates `agents/todo.md` and `agents/issues.csv` if they are missing and describes the workflow in `AGENTS.md`.

### `/ox-plan`

Plans a code or behavior change. Writes a plan to `agents/plans/`.

### `/ox-work`

Implements a plan and commits. Writes a work log to `agents/work/`.

### `/ox-review`

Reviews code in a diff, branch, commit, or files. Fixes findings that have obvious fixes, writes a review to `agents/reviews/`, records the remaining findings in `agents/issues.csv`, adds high and medium severity issues to `agents/todo.md`, checks off the reviewed task, and commits.

## Workflows

Run each step in a fresh session.

### Implement a task

1. `/ox-plan the export task from agents/todo.md`
2. `/ox-work agents/plans/2026-09-25-001-export.md`
3. `/ox-review the last commit`

### Fix an issue

1. `/ox-plan fix OX-0012 from agents/issues.csv`
2. `/ox-work agents/plans/2026-09-25-002-fix-final-token.md`
3. `/ox-review the last commit`

## Global install

From a local checkout:

```bash
npx skills add /path/to/ox-skills -g -a claude-code -a codex -s '*'
```

From GitHub:

```bash
npx skills add kkestell/ox-skills -g -a claude-code -a codex -s '*'
```

## Global Codex instructions

`codex/AGENTS.md` holds personal instructions shared across projects. On another computer, copy it from a checkout to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, merging with an existing file if needed. Installing the skills does not install this file.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex
cp -i codex/AGENTS.md ~/.codex/AGENTS.md
```
